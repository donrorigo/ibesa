# Multi-Objective ESA derived based on Indicators
## Introduction 
This paper presents a possible solution to the problem of homologous recombination (present in the process of creating artificial organisms) by creating an evolutionary algorithm based on the ESA algorithm in conjunction with the IBEA algorithm.

## Getting Started
This project has been developed on Linux Mint Cinnamon, Version 4.0.10
1.	**Installation process**: For the compilation of the project you can find the Makefile in the project folder.
2.	**Software dependencies**: There are no software dependencies.  
3.	**Latest releases**: This code reaches 36 percent in the hypervolume metric.
4.	**API references**: The OpenMP API has been used to allow the use of parallelism.

## Build and Test
The theoretical auxiliary information for the creation of this algorithm has been taken from the following articles:

There are no test files in this project. 
## Contribute
The objective to achieve in this algorithm is to propose a new algorithm that implements several technologies related to the world of multi-objective algorithms. Therefore, the purpose is to achieve the highest percentage of efficiency (a metric to prove such efficiency could be the hypervolume)
